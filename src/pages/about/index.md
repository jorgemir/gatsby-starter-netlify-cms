### My name

My name is spelled with a J. Some people have called me that. But I go by George. It's just been that way my whole life. I like "Horhey" if you speak Spanish but otherwise not so much.

### I live in "LA"

Though I have lived in Los Angeles proper, I don't anymore but when asked and it's of no real meaning, I say I live in LA. It's just easier than explaining I really live in a city called Whittier which is a sublime suburb of "LA".

### I'm a web developer

I had a blog and have had @ev fix a bug or two for me in the early days of Blogger. I'm on twitter and got an email from @jack before I knew jack. I've <a href="oleole.com">started up</a> and <a href="pets.com">burned out</a>. I've worked for the world wide leader and it's in the game. I've been moving forward for so many years now, I've lost track.

### I'm a home brewer

I [brew beer](https://www.instagram.com/mirbrewing/) at home. It's fun and it tastes good most of the time. 

### I'm a dad

I have a lovely wife and we're raising three lovely kids.
