### My name

My name is spelled with a J. Some people have called me that. But I go by George. It's just been that way. I like "Horhey" if you speak Spanish but otherwise not so much.

### I live in "LA"

Though I have lived in Los Angeles proper, I don't anymore but when asked and it's of no real consequence, I still say I live in LA, it's just easier that way. 

I really live in a city called Whittier, where the girls are prettier.

### I'm a web developer

I had a dad. And a blog. I've had @ev fix a bug or two for me in the early days of Blogger. I'm the 123 on twitter and got an email from @jack before I knew jack. I've <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061029071416/http://www.oleole.com/">started up</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000303212454/http://www.pets.com/cgi-bin/puppy/home/home.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=YES&animal=Home">burned out</a>. I've worked for the <a href="https://espn.com">world wide leader</a> and back in the day with <a href="https://ea.com">it's in the game</a>. I've been <a href="https://toyota.com">moving metal</a> for so many years now, I've lost track.

### I'm a home brewer

I [brew beer](https://www.instagram.com/mirbrewing/) at home. It's fun and it tastes good most of the time. 

### I'm a dad

I have a lovely wife and we're raising three lovely kids.
